ARPnMIDI
========

****RP2040 Zero MIDI router / arpeggiator / processor / multitool.****

with SSD1306 OLED display (2-color recommended, yellow on the bottom)

Connect multiple usb midi devices with a hub. Output din/trs or usb midi.

Control live parameters and the appegiator with:

* optical distance sensor (VL53L0X)
* push force pressure sensor (FSR402 sensor with LM393 module)

You can also add a Promicro board as a usb midi device, for full usb-to-usb rounting to another usb host. use this file for the promicro: promicro_usb_din_midi_bridge.txt

This repo keeps the main sketch as `arpnmidi.txt` (not `.ino`) so you can paste it into Arduino IDE without changing board profile/project behavior.

Current Hardware Pin Map (RP2040 Zero board labels)
---------------------------------------------------

Use the pin numbers exactly as printed on the RP2040 Zero board:

- `0` DIN MIDI OUT (TX to DIN/TRS out + Pro Micro RX pin)
- `1` DIN MIDI IN (RX from DIN/TRS with optocoupler or Pro Micro TX pin WITH RESISTORS. 10k from tx to rx pins, 20k from tx to gnd)
- `2` I2C SDA (SSD1306 + VL53L0X on same bus)
- `3` I2C SCL (SSD1306 + VL53L0X on same bus)
- `6` Rotary encoder A
- `7` Rotary encoder B
- `8` Rotary encoder push switch
- `9` Foot pedal 1 input (active low, uses pull-up)
- `10` Foot pedal 2 input (active low, uses pull-up)
- `14` USB host D+
- `15` USB host D-
- `26` Push/pressure analog sensor input (FSR402 sensor with LM393 module)

Pin `11` is intentionally unused, so we can put a screw there.

Build Notes
-----------

BOARD SETUP
- Board: `Waveshare RP2040 Zero`
- USB stack: `Adafruit TinyUSB`
- CPU: `240 MHz` ONLY

- midi USB host uses PIO-USB on pins `14/15`.
- `Adafruit_NeoPixel` must stay disabled in this sketch while USB host is enabled (`ARPNMIDI_ENABLE_RGB_LED 0`), because it conflicts with PIO-USB state machines.
- `Pico-PIO-USB` is vendored in `vendor/Pico-PIO-USB` (tag `0.7.1`) and must be available to Arduino.
- TinyUSB host MIDI support in the installed Arduino-Pico core must define:
  - `#define CFG_TUH_MIDI (CFG_TUH_DEVICE_MAX)`

Runtime Controls
----------------

- Encoder turn in select mode: chooses setting screen.
- Encoder click: toggles select/edit mode.
- Encoder turn in edit mode: changes current parameter.
- Hold encoder while turning in edit mode: coarse step (`+/-10` where relevant).
- Hold encoder button for 2 seconds: panic + host restart/reboot path.
- Screen saver wake: first input only wakes; it does not also apply a parameter change.

Saving Presets
-----------------------

- Flash-backed EEPROM stores 16 presets.
- Exiting any parameter editing AUTO SAVES changes to the current preset.
- `LOAD` loads the selected slot when you click back from edit to select.
- `SAVE` writes current settings into selected slot when you click back from edit to select.
- Factory reset at boot:
  - Hold encoder button during boot.
  - Release when prompted.
  - Press again within 5 seconds to confirm.

Routing Rules
-------------

- Input notes on channels other than `INPUT CH` pass through unchanged.
- If `LEGATO` is set to a channel, notes on that non-`INPUT CH` channel use mono last-note-priority handoff instead of plain passthrough.
- `CC`, `Pitch Bend`, `Program Change`, and `Channel Aftertouch` arriving on `INPUT CH` route to `IN CC >` target(s).
- Non-input-channel `CC/PB/Program/Aftertouch` pass through unchanged.
- Real-time MIDI bytes (clock/start/stop/etc.) are forwarded.
- Current code does not auto-learn BPM from clock (`handleClockByte()` is intentionally empty right now).

Comprehensive Menu Reference (All Screens)
------------------------------------------

- Top screen: pie visualization + division text.

4. `VELOCITY`
- Range: `1..127`.
- Applies to arp note output velocity.
- `VEL DOWN` sensor/push mode can reduce this live while in range.
- Top screen: bar + numeric value.

5. `LENGTH`
- Range: `1..100` percent of step duration.
- Applies to arp gate length.
- `LEN DOWN` sensor/push mode can reduce this live while in range.
- Top screen: bar + percent.

6. `INPUT CH`
- Options: `CH 1..CH 16`.
- Main processing input channel for arp/thru/bass and mapped CC/PB/program routing.

7. `ARP CH`
- Options:
  - `OFF`
  - `CH 1..CH 16`
  - `1+10`
  - `1+10-A`
  - `1-10 24`
  - `1-10 36`
  - `1-10 48`
- `1+10`: main arp on ch1 path plus drum-chord arp lane on ch10.
- `1+10-A`: same as `1+10`, plus ch10 channel aftertouch controls new ch10 drum-lane arp pulse velocity (33% minimum, `42..127`).
- `1-10 24/36/48`: same as `1+10`, plus 8-note split from input channel to ch10 drum lane:
  - `1-10 24`: input notes `24..31` remap to ch10 `36..43`
  - `1-10 36`: input notes `36..43` remap to ch10 `36..43`
  - `1-10 48`: input notes `48..55` remap to ch10 `36..43`
- Drum lane velocity is forced to max (`127`) for `1+10` and `1-10 24/36/48`.

8. `BASS CH`
- Options: `OFF`, then channel groups for `CH1..CH12`.
- Per channel, octave offsets are: `-2`, `-1`, `0`, `+1` oct.
- Behavior: lowest-note-priority mono bass voice.
- If bass channel equals arp channel, bass output is suppressed.

9. `THRU OUT`
- Options: `OFF`, `CH 1..CH 16`.
- Thru path for notes from input channel.
- If thru channel equals bass channel while bass is enabled, thru is suppressed for that channel.

10. `DIV NOTE`
- Cursor options:
  - Division slots: `1/4`, `1/4T`, `1/8`, `1/8T`, `1/16`, `1/16T`, `1/32`, `1/32T`, `1/64`
  - `+NOTE`
  - `RESET`
- In edit mode:
  - On a division slot, play a note (any channel) to map that note+channel to the division.
  - When mapped note is held, arp temporarily switches to that division.
  - If `+NOTE` is blank, mapped trigger note is swallowed.
  - If `+NOTE` has a note value, mapped trigger note is replaced by `+NOTE` and then processed normally.
- `RESET` clears all division-note mappings and `+NOTE` when you exit edit mode on `RESET`.

11. `MAP CC`
- Cursor options:
  - Param slots: `BPM`, `ARP`, `DIV`, `VEL`, `LEN`, `IN`, `ACH`, `BCH`, `TCH`, `INCC`, `EYCH`, `EYMD`, `PSMD`, `KEY`, `SCL`, `LOAD`
  - `CLEAR`
  - `CH:SET` / `CH:ALL`
- In edit mode on a param slot, send a CC to learn that CC number and channel for that slot.
- `EYMD` / `PSMD` mapping excludes `CC 1..CC 19` and `LOOP TRIG` options.
- `CLEAR` clears all MAP CC assignments when you exit edit mode on `CLEAR`.
- `CH:SET`/`CH:ALL` toggles when you exit edit mode on that row:
  - `CH:SET`: mapped CC must match both learned CC and learned channel.
  - `CH:ALL`: mapped CC number works from any incoming channel.
- `LOAD` map target switches and loads preset immediately.
- Parameter changes from MAP CC are live and persist to the current preset (same autosave behavior as normal edits).
- MAP CC assignments are stored per preset and restore on boot/load with that preset.
- For stepped parameters, incoming CC is thresholded to target steps to avoid jitter.
- Display jumps to the changed parameter screen after movement settles, to avoid over-refreshing while CC is moving quickly.

12. `IN CC >`
- Options: `CH 1..CH 16`, `ALL3`.
- Affects routing of input-channel `CC`, `Pitch Bend`, `Program Change`, and `Channel Aftertouch`.
- `ALL3` fans these messages to arp/thru/bass channel outputs (de-duplicated).

13. `LEGATO`
- Options: `OFF`, `CH 1..CH 16`.
- Applies to note messages on the selected non-`INPUT CH` lane.
- Behavior: monophonic last-note priority with explicit handoff:
  - newest pressed note becomes active output
  - releasing that note re-activates the previous still-held note
  - when no held notes remain, output note is released

14. `REMOTE`
- Options: `CH 1..CH 16`.
- Output channel used by both foot pedal remote actions (`REMOTE 1` and `REMOTE 2`).

15. `REMOTE 1`
- Action sent when pedal 1 goes low.
- Value mapping:
  - `0..127` => note number pulse
  - `128..254` => CC `1..127` pulse
- Pulse length uses project pedal pulse timing.

16. `REMOTE 2`
- Same action model as `REMOTE 1`, for pedal 2.

17. `USB HOST`
- Options: `OFF`, `IN ONLY`, `IN/OUT`.
- Changing this setting reboots after exiting edit mode so host stack restarts cleanly.
- `IN/OUT` enables USB host TX fanout as well as input.

18. `SCRNSVR`
- Options: `OFF`, `AUTO`, `NOW`.
- `AUTO`: enters after idle timeout.
- `NOW`: immediate manual activation (not persisted as always-on).
- Saver redraws procedurally and refreshes on interval.

19. `EYE/PUSH`
- Options: `CH 1..CH 16`.
- Shared output channel for both `EYE MODE` and `PUSH` generated notes/cc/pitch/loop messages.

20. `EYE MODE`
- Modes:
  - `OFF`
  - `DIV +2`, `DIV -2`, `DIV +3`, `DIV -3`, `DIV FULL`, `DIV3`
  - `VEL DOWN`, `LEN DOWN`
  - `ARP LATCH`, `ARP LATCH+`
  - `ARP FREEZE`, `ARP FREEZ+`
  - `PITCH UP`, `PITCH DOWN`
  - `NOTES C0..NOTES C7` (2-oct note ranges)
  - `CC 1..CC 19`
  - `LOOP TRIG`
- Division overlay modes currently target `DIVISION` only.
- `DIV3` profile: far zone most-slowing, middle less-slowing, close small zone speed-up.
- `ARP LATCH`: latch arp notes; wave over sensor to clear latch phrase.
- `ARP LATCH+`: latch arp plus thru/bass behavior.
- `ARP FREEZE`: wave over sensor to lock notes into frozen arp set.
- `ARP FREEZ+`: freeze mode with thru path freeze support as well.
- `NOTES Cx`: quantized note output with edge padding and range trims.
- `LOOP TRIG`: sends note `103` or `104` pulse based on proximity.

21. `PUSH`
- Same mode list and behavior family as `EYE MODE`.
- Input source is analog pressure on pin `26`.
- Uses calibrated thresholds and curved response so light press is less aggressive.
- Shares channel with `EYE/PUSH` setting.

22. `KEY`
	**WARNING while on key/guitar screens like this, rapid notes will slow the arp due to refreshing the display**
- Options:
  - `OFF`
  - standard key roots: `C..B`
  - alternate white-key mapper roots: `CKEY C..CKEY B`
- `CKEY` engages white-key-to-scale-position mapping.

23. `SCALE`
- Options:
  - `OFF`
  - `MAJOR`
  - `MINOR`
  - `MAJ+MIN`
  - `BLUES`
  - `MAJ BLUES`
  - `BLUES+BOTH`
- `HARM MIN`
- `MEL MIN`
- In `CKEY` mode, combo scales are skipped (`MAJ+MIN`, `BLUES+BOTH`).

24. `GIT/KEYS`
- Options: `GUITAR`, `PIANO`.
- Chooses visualization style for key/scale pages.
- Saved in preset and restored on boot/load.

25. `LOAD`
- Select preset slot `1..16` in edit mode.
- Preset is actually loaded when you click back to select mode.
- Grid view shows slot location.

26. `SAVE`
- Select destination slot `1..16` in edit mode.
- Slot is written when you click back to select mode.
- Grid view shows slot location.

27. `PANIC`
- Top screen in this page is USB overload debug:
	**WARNING if you stay on this screen, rapid notes will slow the arp due to refreshing the display**
  - device counts
  - queue depth and drop counters
  - overload risk flag
  - last incoming channel/note and on/off state
  - RX age timing
